/**
 * The no-3MF banner has to say the right thing (#2780).
 *
 * It used to have one wording for every cause: "Store sent files on external
 * storage" is off in the slicer, go and turn it on. On H2-series and P2S that
 * is wrong twice over -- the setting is already on, and turning it on again
 * changes nothing, because the printer keeps the sliced file on internal
 * storage that FTPS does not serve at all. #2780's reporter followed that
 * advice, and #1170's before them.
 *
 * A third cause joined them in #1820: a print started from the printer's own
 * screen, where no slicer was involved at all and both of the wordings above
 * describe a step the operator never took.
 *
 * And a fourth, which is why this file grew again: a printer whose file service
 * refused the TLS handshake, so no lookup ever ran. #2957 recorded that cause
 * and nothing surfaced it, so those installs fell to the generic wording and
 * were told to switch on a setting that was already on, about a file they could
 * see sitting on the stick.
 *
 * So these assert the wording actually shown, not just that a banner rendered.
