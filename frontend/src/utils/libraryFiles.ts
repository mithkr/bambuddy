 * Is a library file sliced — does it carry printer-executable G-code?
 *
 * The name alone is not evidence (#2993). A plate exported from Studio, or a
 * print dispatched through the cloud, is a fully sliced 3MF called `Foo.3mf`,
 * and deciding from the extension filed those as source-only projects with no
 * Print button — while the Archives card, which looks inside the zip, showed
 * the same file's green GCODE badge. The backend now classifies on content, so
 * `file_type` answers where the name cannot.
 *
 * Either signal is enough, which mirrors `classify_file_type` on the backend:
 * it returns `gcode.3mf` for a `.gcode.3mf` name without opening the file at
 * all, and only consults the zip when the name has not already settled it. A
 * row stored before the backfill therefore keeps its Print button on the
 * strength of its name.

/**

 * as name-bound as the Print gate it sits beside (#2993), so once a sliced
 * `Foo.3mf` correctly gained a Print button it would have been offered a
 * Slice one as well: re-slicing its own G-code.
 *
 * `desktopSlicer` is required even when `useSlicerApi` is true, where it is not
 * consulted: the desktop answer depends on which slicer the URL is handed to
 * (#3029), and a caller that cannot name one has not yet decided what its
 * button will do.
