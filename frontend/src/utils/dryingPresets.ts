/**
 * Pick the preset key for a tray's material.
 *
 * The answer is always a key the table actually has, which is the whole point:
 * the drying popover seeds both the temperature and the filament name the start
 * command carries from this, and the dropdown silently falls back to its first
 * option when handed a value that isn't in its list. Seeding it with a raw
 * `tray_type` therefore displayed "PLA" while sending the raw string -- an
 * AMS-HT holding Support for PLA/PETG (`tray_type` "PLA-S") showed PLA in the
 * dropdown and told the printer PLA-S (#2774).
 *
 * `tray_type` carries plenty of spellings the table doesn't list: support
 * materials (PLA-S) and composites (PETG-CF, PLA-CF, ABS-GF, PAHT-CF) all dry
 * as their base material, so the suffix is dropped before giving up. Anything
 * still unrecognised lands on PLA, deliberately the coolest row -- under-drying
 * an exotic filament wastes a cycle, where defaulting to PA's 85 degrees would
 * deform a PLA spool.
