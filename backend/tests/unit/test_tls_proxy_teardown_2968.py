"""The RTSPS proxy must not leave a handler running past its server (#2968).

The reporter's log carries three of these, one per camera snapshot, at ERROR
with a traceback pointing into ``camera.py``:

    ERROR [asyncio] Task was destroyed but it is pending!
    task: <Task pending name='Task-1889625'
      coro=<create_tls_proxy.<locals>._handle() done, defined at camera.py:243>
      wait_for=<_GatheringFuture pending ...>>

``asyncio.start_server`` wraps the connection callback in a task and keeps only
a weak reference to it, so a handler still awaiting its two forwarders can be
collected while pending -- which is exactly what that message is. Nothing was
broken by it (the snapshot on either side of each one succeeded), but it reads
like a camera fault in a log people attach to bug reports, and the shape behind
it is real: teardown closed the listener and then waited on handlers that only
finish when the *peer* drops the socket.

Two things fix it. The handlers are strongly referenced for as long as they run,
and ``close_tls_proxy`` cancels them rather than hoping ffmpeg has already gone.

The upstream here is a real TLS listener rather than a bare socket, because the
proxy spends its first ten seconds inside ``open_connection``: a stand-in that
never completes a handshake never reaches the forwarding state these tests are
about. The proxy sets ``CERT_NONE`` (Bambu printers are self-signed), so a
throwaway certificate is all it takes.
