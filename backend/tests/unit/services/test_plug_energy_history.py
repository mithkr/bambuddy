"""Today / Yesterday derived from a plug's lifetime energy counter (#2539).

The reporter's Shelly Plug S Gen3 reports one number, ``aenergy.total``, and it
only ever climbs. Bambuddy filed that under "today", so Today never reset at
midnight and Yesterday and Total stayed at zero forever. These tests pin the
arithmetic that replaces it, and the two ways it can legitimately have no answer.
