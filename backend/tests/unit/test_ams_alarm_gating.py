"""Tests for the gates that hold back AMS humidity / temperature alarms.

Two independent gates, both sitting in ``record_ams_history``'s dispatch: the
empty-AMS gate (#1619) documented below, and the drying gate (#1802) that stops
the temperature alarm firing throughout a drying cycle and the cool-down after
it.

Empty-AMS alarm gate (#1619).

Empty AMS units still emit humidity/temperature sensor readings, but those
readings are ambient and not actionable — there's no filament to dry. Without
the gate every empty AMS spammed an hourly alarm. ``_ams_has_filament``
inspects the firmware-reported ``tray_exist_bits`` bitmap (fallback: ``tray``
array's ``tray_type`` strings) so the alarm dispatch in ``record_ams_history``
can skip empty units while still alarming on loaded ones in the same printer.
