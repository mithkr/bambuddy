"""The RTSP camera paths must not become a request generator for arbitrary hosts.

`_sanitize_camera_url` is the SSRF boundary for user-configured camera URLs. It
was applied to the MJPEG and snapshot paths but not to the two RTSP ones, which
handed the URL to `ffmpeg -i` unchecked — and ffmpeg's `-i` speaks http, tcp,
file and everything else it was built with, so `camera_type=rtsp` was a way to
name any destination and any protocol.

Wiring the guard in is only half of it. The guard rebuilt URLs from
`parsed.hostname`, which drops credentials and unbrackets IPv6 literals, and it
recognised loopback by comparing against four spellings of it. So these tests
pin three things at once: the RTSP paths refuse what they should, the guard
recognises a destination however it is written, and a real camera — which
usually means an authenticated one — still works.
