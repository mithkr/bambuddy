"""Regression tests for the #2572 timelapse-scan session-boundary refactor.

``POST /archives/{id}/timelapse/scan`` used to hold its ``Depends(get_db)``
session open across the FTP directory listing *and* the multi-MB video
download. It now (1) reads the archive + printer in a short session and
releases the pooled connection *before* the FTP work, then (2) re-opens a
fresh short session only to attach the downloaded file.

Two things that refactor could have broken, one test each:

* The matching logic reads ``archive.filename/started_at/completed_at/
  created_at`` and ``printer.ip_address/...`` AFTER the read session has
  closed. If any were a lazy-loaded relationship (or an expired column) that
  would raise ``DetachedInstanceError``. The not-found test drives every
  match strategy, exercising all of those detached reads.

* The attach write runs in a *fresh* ``async_session()``, which — unlike
  ``get_db`` — does NOT auto-commit on block exit. If ``attach_timelapse``
  didn't commit internally the write would be silently dropped. The attach
  test asserts the row is actually persisted.

FTP is fully mocked, so no printer is contacted.
