"""Which nozzle an AMS slot feeds, with or without a Filament Track Switch.

K-profiles are per-nozzle: a calibration run belongs to the hotend it ran on,
and ``cali_idx: 16`` can name a different profile on each. (It need not — one
profile can also be what both extruders' slots point at, which is why the K
lookup in ``kprofile_lookup`` treats the extruder as a preference rather than a
filter — but the routing question below is the same either way.) Without a
switch the answer is unambiguous, because each AMS is wired to one extruder and
says so in its ``info`` bits. With a switch installed every AMS reports 0xE
instead and is bound to a switch *inlet*, so the answer has to come from the
inlet binding.

Every caller that resolves a slot to an extruder should go through
``slot_extruder`` here. Three separate copies of that logic used to end in
``else 0``, which on a switch machine silently filed every profile under the
right-hand nozzle regardless of where the slot actually was.

Kept as a leaf module with no imports of its own so the routes, the MQTT layer
and the scheduler can all share one answer.

# Which extruder each switch outlet terminates at. Measured on the maintainer's
# H2C, 2026-08-16: Out-A is the left hotend, Out-B is the right one.
#
# We would rather read this than assert it, but it is not in the telemetry:
# ``fila_switch.out`` reported ``[1, 1]`` unchanged across a 90-second capture,
# i.e. both outlets claiming the same extruder, which cannot describe real
# wiring. Whatever that field means, it is not outlet-to-nozzle.
#
# The inlet-to-outlet pairing then comes from the switch's un-crossed rest
# position: In-A -> Out-A, In-B -> Out-B. The switch does cross the two during a
# filament change, so this describes where a slot sits between prints, which is
# what a manual "configure this slot" task needs. It is deliberately one table
# to change if a machine turns up with its outlet tubes swapped.
