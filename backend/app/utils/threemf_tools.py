    On dual-nozzle printers (H2D, H2D Pro), each filament slot is assigned to a
    specific nozzle. The slicer may override user preferences when using "Auto For
    Flush" mode, so the actual assignment comes from slice_info.config group_id
    attributes, not from the user's filament_nozzle_map preference.

    Priority:
        1. group_id on <filament> elements in slice_info.config (actual assignment),
           resolved through the file's own group-to-extruder table
        2. filament_nozzle_map in project_settings.config (user preference fallback)

    Both are mapped through physical_extruder_map to get MQTT extruder IDs (0=right, 1=left).

    Returns None rather than a partial answer whenever a filament the plate
    prints cannot be placed. The gap does not stay a gap downstream: the dense
    form fills it with -1, which already means "slot not printed", and
    dispatching that against an ams_mapping that *does* name a tray for the slot
    is a contradiction the firmware rejects outright with HMS 0500-4047, "the

# Keys in ``Metadata/project_settings.config`` that Bambu Studio writes an
# "inherit / unset" marker into, mapped to the marker it uses for that key.
# The slicer CLI's ``StaticPrintConfig`` validator runs against the embedded
# settings *before* ``--load-settings`` overrides apply, so a marker the CLI's
# own range check rejects makes it exit non-zero before our profile triplet is
# ever consulted.
#
# There are two markers because there are two conventions, and which one a
# given CLI rejects depends on the build:
#
#   "-1" -- inherit from the parent process preset (#1201, MakerWorld P2S
#   3MFs). ``raft_first_layer_expansion`` and ``tree_support_wall_count`` are
#   min 0 in every OrcaSlicer to date, so those still fail on the current
#   sidecar; ``prime_tower_brim_width`` gained min -1 in Orca 2.4.2 and now
#   passes there, but not on older builds.
#
#   "0" -- "use the active object/part filament", the default Bambu Studio
#   writes for the three feature-filament indices (#3030). Bambu Studio and
#   OrcaSlicer 2.4.0+ both define these min 0, so 0 is legal there; OrcaSlicer
#   2.3.x and earlier still used the 1-based scheme (min 1, default 1) and
#   reject it with ``0 not in range [1.000000,...]``. Sidecar images are
#   version-tagged, so an install can be pinned to one of those.
#
# Removing the key rather than rewriting it is what makes this safe on every
# build: the CLI then falls back to its own compiled default, which is 0 on
# the builds where 0 was legal (so nothing changes) and 1 on the older ones,
# which is what "the active filament" means under that scheme.
#
# Allowlisted (rather than "strip every marker-shaped value") because some
# fields legitimately take the marker value -- z_offset, translations, and any
# feature index a user really did set to a first filament -- and a blanket
# strip would silently corrupt those.
#

    Removes only allowlisted keys (see ``PROJECT_SETTINGS_SENTINELS``) and only
    when the value is exactly that key's sentinel. The rest of the config --
    and every other entry in the zip -- is preserved byte-for-byte. Unlike a
    whole-file strip this leaves ``StaticPrintConfig`` initialisation intact:
    the file is still present, still parses, and the slicer falls back to the
    supplied ``--load-settings`` value, or to its own default, for the removed
    key.

    Returns the original bytes unchanged when no sanitisation is needed (input
    isn't a valid zip, no ``project_settings.config``, no allowlisted sentinels
    present, or any other parse failure) so the caller can pass the result on
