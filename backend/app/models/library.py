    both open features need that answer from opposite ends: the print queue

    print action has the printer already and needs the same match (#2570).

    member's target model comes from its own ``file_metadata['sliced_for_model']``,
    parsed out of the 3MF, so a group can never disagree with the files it
    contains. It also carries no pointer to an unsliced source file: that is a
    display concern for the grouped File Manager listing, which is not built.

    side is ON DELETE SET NULL) — every member is independently printable.
