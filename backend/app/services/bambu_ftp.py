# Every FTP call below is blocking ftplib work handed to a thread. They used to
# run on asyncio's *default* executor, which is sized min(32, cpu_count + 4) —
# six threads on a 2-core NAS — and is shared with every other ``to_thread`` /
# ``run_in_executor`` caller in the app. That was survivable only because the
# scheduler uploaded to exactly one printer at a time. Dispatching to several
# printers at once (#2555) would park one thread per in-flight upload for
# minutes at a stretch (a 41 MB 3MF at the ~150 KB/s a Bambu printer sustains
# takes ~4 min), starving the default pool and stalling unrelated work.
#
# A dedicated pool keeps that blast radius inside the FTP layer: the scheduler's
# own concurrency cap is what limits parallel uploads, and it can never exhaust
# the executor everything else depends on. Threads are created lazily, so an
# idle pool costs nothing.
#
# Sized well above `queue_max_concurrent_uploads` (max 16), because uploads are
# not the only traffic here: SD browsing, timelapse/recording listing, cover
# downloads, deletes and storage checks all run through this pool too, and on a
# farm they fan out across every printer at once. The pool's work queue is
# unbounded, so exceeding it does not fail — it queues. But `asyncio.wait_for`
# starts its clock at submission, not at thread start, so a task that sits in the
# queue can burn its whole timeout without ever running, and `list_files_async`
# reports a timeout as an empty listing — a silent "this printer has no files".
# Keep the headroom.

# sustains over WiFi legitimately needs ~20 minutes, and the old flat 600 s
# declared it dead at ~70 MB. The deadline is therefore derived from the file
# size against a deliberately pessimistic floor rate. This is a backstop, not the

# allowed to serve. A reporter measured the same 5.4 MB 3MF at 45 s off a worn
# P1S SD card and 25 s off a new one, and a 15.15 MB 3MF at 105 s; a 7.8 MB
# archive in his older logs survived only because it finished inside the retry
# grace. None of those transfers were unhealthy -- they were slow, which is what
# the inactivity timeout is for and what a total deadline cannot tell apart.
#
# So the total deadline follows the file instead, at the same pessimistic floor
# rate the upload path uses. The extension is granted only once the printer has
