"""Can FTPS see the file this print is running from? (#2780)

Bambuddy reads a print's 3MF, cover and timelapse off the printer over implicit
FTPS on port 990. On every Bambu model that port serves **external storage only**
-- the SD card or USB stick. It is not a view of the printer's filesystem.

H2-series, P2S and X2D firmware default to keeping the sliced file on internal
eMMC instead, and BambuStudio uploads there over a separate service on port 6000
(the "BambuTunnelLocal" protocol -- see #2762, which tracks implementing it).
The dispatch says where it went: the ``project_file`` command carries ``url``,
which is ``ftp://<name>`` for external storage and ``brtc://emmc/<name>`` for
internal.

Before this module we ignored ``url`` and swept anyway: six filename variants
across five directories with up to four retries for the 3MF, then sixteen more
paths for the cover, then the timelapse scan -- roughly 110 FTPS connections per
print, every one of them certain to 550. The user-visible result was an archive
card with nothing on it and no stated reason, which read as a Bambuddy bug and
was reported as one four times (#1170, #2524, #2762, #2780).

But that URL is not the last word on reachability, and reading it as one was
itself a regression (#2856). It says where the printer *chose* to put the file,
not whether port 990 can serve it -- measured on an H2D (firmware 01.03.00.00,
card in the slot): every ``brtc://emmc/<name>`` print of that reporter's was
sitting under ``/cache/<name>`` and downloaded fine, 19 MB included, until this
module started skipping the lookup. On #2780's P2S and H2C the same URL really
did mean nothing was there. So an internal-storage URL earns a *bounded probe*
rather than a skip: it names the exact file, which turns the 110-connection
sweep into one connection walking five paths, and the answer comes from the
printer instead of from a guess about its model. Only when that probe misses
does the verdict's ``reason`` stand -- see :func:`probe_filename_from_url` and
:func:`ftp_probe_paths`, and the callers that run it.

The rule here is deliberately one-sided: **skip only on positive evidence**.
Silence is not evidence -- a printer that never publishes ``sdcard`` and never
had a ``project_file`` pass through the request topic (some brokers refuse the
subscription) must keep the old behaviour exactly, or this becomes a regression
for installs whose archives work fine today.
