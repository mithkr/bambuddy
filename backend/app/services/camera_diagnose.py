"""End-to-end camera diagnostic, surfaced via ``POST /printers/{id}/camera/diagnose``.

Cuts off the "camera broken" support-ticket loop at the user's screen by
running the printer-side camera path through staged checks (TCP, end-
to-end frame capture) and reporting WHICH stage failed plus a
remediation key the frontend can render translated.

The goal isn't to be a perfect protocol analyser — it's to be the diff
between "user opens a ticket with 'connection lost'" and "user sees
'Printer not reachable; check IP and LAN-only mode'" before they ever
write a message.

Stages
------

1. **tcp_reachable** — open a TCP socket to the camera port (322 for
   RTSPS models, 6000 for the chamber-image-protocol A1 / P1 family).
   Distinguishes "printer down" / "firewall" / "LAN-only off" from
   stream-content problems.
2. **first_frame** — call the existing ``capture_camera_frame_bytes``
   pipeline (same code that powers /camera/snapshot) and verify at
   least one JPEG comes back within the model's profile-derived
   timeout. Combines auth + protocol handshake + first keyframe into
   one stage because splitting RTSP's ``ffmpeg`` invocation is heavy
   and the user-facing answer is the same either way: "the camera
   itself isn't producing frames".

Shortcut
--------

Most Bambu firmwares allow exactly one concurrent camera connection.
Opening a fresh socket while a viewer is attached would kick them off
(and trigger the same #1348 reconnect-storm pattern we built the fan-
out broadcaster to prevent). When ``is_stream_active`` reports True
AND a buffered frame is fresh (last 10 s), we short-circuit the test
with ``live_stream_active`` and report success — the user is
literally watching the camera right now, no test needed.

The related case is another one-shot capture (Obico polling, the cam
wall) being in flight when the user hits Diagnose. There the capture
layer coalesces for us (#2705) and no competing socket is opened, but
the frame we get back was someone else's — so ``first_frame`` still
passes and carries a ``coalesced_capture`` code, because a diagnostic
that reports a connection it didn't open is worse than a slow one.
