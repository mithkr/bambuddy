#   - `ams_mapping2` and per-unit commands use the **physical** id 16.
# So we normalise 16 -> 6 at the MQTT ingest boundary. Global tray ids then land
# at 24-27, which every `ams_id*4+slot` consumer handles unchanged, collides with
# nothing (regular AMS 0-15, AMS-HT 128-135, external 254/255) and passes the

    sent and reports ``result: "success"``, so only the next AMS push shows what
    was really stored. Measured on the reporter's machine (#2987), where the
    spool's own ``rgba`` is stored lowercase and went out verbatim:

    `tray_exist_bits` is firmware's canonical "which slots have a spool" bitmask
    (BambuStudio uses it too). For every slot whose bit is 0, promote the tray
    `state` to 9 (firmware's "no spool" code) and clear `tray_type` / `tray_color`
    / `tray_info_idx` / `tag_uid` / `tray_uuid` / `remain` etc so downstream
    readers (Bambuddy's AMS card, the VP slicer-facing cache, inventory short-
    circuits keyed on `state in {9, 10}`) all see one canonical empty-slot signal
    instead of guessing from payload shape (#1322, #147).

    Two callers share this helper to keep their views consistent:

    1. ``_handle_ams_data`` for Bambuddy's internal AMS state (printer card).
    2. ``virtual_printer.mqtt_bridge._on_printer_raw`` for the cached slicer-
       facing push_status (#1726 — without this the VP would forward stale
       per-tray fields for empty slots, and BambuStudio's Sync would render
       phantom loaded slots).

    Skipped only on the printer-shutdown pattern: all-zero bits paired with
    ``power_on_flag=False`` (#765). Non-zero bits with ``power_on_flag=False``
    is valid idle-printer state (#1365 — X1C between prints) and MUST be applied
    so spool removal is detected without requiring a manual reconnect.

    AMS-HT units (``id`` 128-135) are single-tray dry boxes whose presence bit
    is packed as ONE consecutive bit starting at 16 (``16 + (ams_id - 128)``),
    NOT ``ams_id * 4`` (which would overflow to bit 512+). This is the firmware's
    authoritative empty signal for the HT — the only working clear path, since
    the HT keeps echoing stale ``tray_type`` and its ``state`` is firmware-variant
    (#2670). Verified against OrcaSlicer ``DevFilaSystem.cpp``
    (``is_exists = tray_exist_bits >> (16 + (ams_id-128))``) and a live H2D
    capture (HT-A → bit 16). The A2L-Lite lands at bits 24-27 via the regular
    ``ams_id * 4`` formula, matching OrcaSlicer's ``AMS_LITE_MIXED`` offset; the
    unit id is folded through ``normalize_am_unit_id`` first so callers holding
    the raw physical id 16 get the same bit base as callers holding the
    normalised 6 (#2697).

    `tray_exist_bits_str` is expected as a hex string (firmware sends it that
    way). Ints are tolerated for defensive symmetry but typically not seen
    on the wire. ``None`` / empty / unparseable → no-op.

    ``annotate_exists`` writes a per-tray ``exists`` bool (from the bitmask) on
    every processed slot. This is firmware's authoritative "spool physically
    present" signal — the same one BambuStudio uses to draw a ``?`` for a
    non-RFID spool in an otherwise-unidentified slot. Bambuddy's AMS card keys
    empty-vs-unknown off it so a non-Bambu spool shows ``?`` instead of "Empty"
    (#2527). Only the internal (printer-card) caller sets this; the VP bridge
    leaves it False so the ``exists`` key never reaches the slicer wire format.

    Mutates ``units`` in place. Returns the number of slots cleared.

        A cycle that reaches its configured duration needs no explanation and

        with most of its countdown left was ended by somebody, and there are
        only two candidates: a stop Bambuddy sent — the print-takes-priority
        stop, or the user's Stop button — which is named as such, or the
        firmware.

        For the firmware case the only account of why lives in fields we already
        parse but have never written down: the ``dry_status`` /
        ``dry_sub_status`` phase from the info hex, the per-unit
        ``dry_sf_reason`` constraint codes, and whatever HMS errors are live at
        that moment. Logging them at INFO puts them in every support bundle by
        default, which is what a report like #2770 needs before its cause can be
        argued about at all.

        whether auto-drying re-arms. Reconstructing them for #2770 meant
        cross-referencing hourly alarm lines against 30-second scheduler debug
        that was switched off at the time; one line here says it outright — a

            #     Printer is sliced against the VP, which advertises no AMS, so the
            #     slicer sends use_ams=false and that gets stamped on the queue item
            #     — but at dispatch the scheduler colour-matches a real printer and
            #     resolves a real AMS slot. Without this, the stale False reaches the
            #     printer, which ignores the mapped slot and aborts at layer 0 on the
            #     empty external spool ("not enough filament"). Diagnosed by
            #     @Sawtaytoes (#2595, PR #2596).
            #
            # (b) Only an *explicit* external/virtual spool (254/255) may downgrade
            #     to use_ams=False. P1S/P1P with no AMS rejects use_ams=True with
            #     "Failed to get AMS mapping table". An unresolved slot (-1) does
            #     NEITHER: it means the mapping was never resolved — e.g. a frontend
