"""Connection diagnostic for Bambu printers.

Runs the checks a maintainer performs by hand when triaging a
"printer won't connect / won't print" report — port reachability, LAN
developer mode, container network mode, subnet match, and MQTT credentials —
so users can self-diagnose setup problems instead of opening an issue.

See the 2026-05-21 issue-triage analysis: ~1/3 of closed issues were
user-side setup errors clustered on exactly these causes.

    # firmware/slicer combo: on newer firmware the toggle lives on the
    # printer (P2S 01.02 / BambuStudio 2.6+), on older versions it's
    # purely a slicer-side preference.
    #
    # For the printer-side variant, `home_flag` bit 11 is pushed on every
    # status report and parsed into state.store_to_sdcard (bambu_mqtt.py
    # line 153). That's the signal here — instant, no FTP I/O.
    #
    # For the slicer-side variant, the printer never hears about it and
    # this check will pass even when the user is missing step 4. That gap
    # is covered separately by the "no_3mf_available" archive-fallback
    # banner. An FTP upload-and-verify probe was tried and rejected — the
    # /cache directory is always writable from Bambuddy regardless of
    # either toggle, so the probe always passes and detects nothing.
